     <p>Seiko's history began in 1881,The company originated from a small store where a man used to make watches and repair them.

He along with his loyal workers started a small company "Sio" but the name was later changed in 1905 to "Seiko" <br>

     Seiko released the first pocket watch in 1895, the first wristwatch in 1913 and the first Seiko-branded watch in 1924. Seiko also presented Seiko UC-2000 in 1983, but this series was discontinued after sometime.
